                The application offers layout and decoration for a completely empty room,
                such as helping to rearrange and redecorate an already furnished and furnished room.
                At the end, the application offers to view the result in 3D in the application, but
                also (and above all) in augmented reality directly in the room! At this stage, he can
                even move the furniture displayed, select others, delete or add them manually and change
                their color and style. To generate the result in 3D or augmented reality, we decided to use 3D models.

                These 3D models are provided to us directly by the partner brands whose catalog is
                present in the application. If the partners do not have 3D models, we will offer them
                conversion solutions in order to be compatible with our service. In the worst case,
                we can adapt to them and offer support for additional formats according to the needs of our partners.
