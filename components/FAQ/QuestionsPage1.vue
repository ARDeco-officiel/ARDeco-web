                ARDeco is a mobile application for scanning the room using the phone.
                Our AI then generates an interior layout and decoration based on the budget
                and style defined by the user. He will visualize the result in augmented reality
                and will be able to buy the furniture (automatically arranged) from the partners
                directly from the application.

                The user can first enter a budget range and/or a maximum budget not to be exceeded.
                He can also select different styles that he would like in his room (for example zen,
                industrial, classic, forest, etc...). He will then simply have to use his phone camera,
                and perform a scan of the room by following the instructions indicated on the screen and
                checking the veracity of the information calculated and transcribed. It is possible that
                the application asks the user to enter one or more distances manually to perform more
                precise calculations.
