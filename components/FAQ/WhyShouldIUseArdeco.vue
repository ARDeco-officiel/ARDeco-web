            The project therefore saves time when furnishing your room.
            Thanks to the budget and style selection, the scanning of
            the room to capture the dimensions of the walls and furniture
            (if present in the room) and the AI previously described which
            retrieves furniture corresponding to the criteria and dimensions
            then pose, saving user time and agent. Another improvement that the
            project brings to the user is that he is sure of the final rendering
            of his room and will not be disappointed, since he can visualize in augmented
            reality in his room the final arrangement, and even carry out tests to be sure.
