            These 3D models are provided to us directly by the partner brands whose catalog is
            present in the application. If the partners do not have 3D models, we will offer them
            conversion solutions in order to be compatible with our service. In the worst case,
            we can adapt to them and offer support for additional formats according to the needs of our partners.
